To Do
-------
1) - when no gps, find city or state, same for when gps location isn't near bathroom
- if too far away from bathroom, response body is empty for json -- make a call nearest location
- text directions temp fix -- remove (textdirectionactivity)
- not finding actual closest location?
2) - text directions action bar -- back button, settitle
3) - materialize buttons -- rectangle -- color
4) - action button picture
5) - green action bar -- status bar -- material status bar
6) - navigation drawer icon
- red markers vs blue markers? accessibility
7) - take off unisex parameter?
8) - gender neutral bathroom email
-- settings icon shows up on nav drawer open
- style Feedback Form better
- make text directions prettier -- directions.html
- actionbar activity depreciated
- better add bathroom section, not webview, loads faster, after submitting
- more info in info window
- contact form without email client -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2020088/sending-email-in-android-using-javamail-api-without-using-the-default-built-in-a/2033124#2033124

- get location from wifi when no mCurrentLocation -- also for webview
- Make maps info window appear at bottom of screen, like google maps -- might have to do this as a dynamic text view

- Add bathroom rating to info window
- Update text directions while on tab?
- Allow get directions from selecting icon
- Screen rotation reupdates map to beginning location...
- Going to text and then back, messes up location and next
