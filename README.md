# Refuge Restrooms
Android app for [Refuge Restrooms](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/)

Merged this project with [Refuge Restrooms App](https://github.com/RefugeRestrooms/refugerestrooms-android)!! So work on the project there: https://github.com/RefugeRestrooms/refugerestrooms-android

## Getting started
You can use Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) to build this project, and it should behave like any other android studio project.

Clone the repo here and the in Android Studio go to File -> New -> Import Project and navigate to your clone.

## Functionality
- Works best with GPS Location enabled
- Uses [Google Maps Gestures](https://support.google.com/gmm/answer/3139292?hl=en)
- Selecting location marker shows bathroom info and changes navigation to that location
- Navigation icon in the top right gives text directions
- Blue marker = accessible, red marker = not accessible
- "Alt" Folder/Source files are from original android app
- When GPS isn't enabled
  - Popup box will recommend turning it on initial app start
  - Navigation icon gives a toast to enable location
  - Selecting marker doesn't give location
  - Currently location defaults to Minneapolis (Fix this!)
- If no bathroom within 30(ish?) miles, no results are given by refuge restrooms api, so a toast displays to the user that no bathrooms are nearby

## TODO
- [ ] Signed keystore for play store
- [ ] Search bar
- [ ] Get and set nearby location when gps is disabled (currently defaults to Minneapolis)
- [ ] Detailed info button like in ios app, Add bathroom rating to info window
- [ ] Indicate red markers vs blue markers for accessibility
- [ ] Navigate button floating action button instead?
- [ ] Style
  - [ ] Style Feedback Form better
  - [ ] Navigation drawer icons
  - [ ] Style text directions section -- directions.html
- [ ] Better add bathroom section, currently just a webview
- [ ] Contact form without email client
- [ ] Update text directions while on tab
- [ ] Actionbar activity depreciated (HttpClient as well)
- [ ] Enable crash reports

## Bugs
- [ ] Screen rotation re-updates map to initial closest location
- [ ] Turning location off after it's been on doesn't grab last known location on app reopen
